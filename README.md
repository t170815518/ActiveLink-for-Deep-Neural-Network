# ActiveLink-for-Deep-Neural-Network

This repo contains the implementation of ActiveLink (*Ref: Ostapuk, N., et al. (2019). ActiveLink: Deep Active Learning for Link Prediction in Knowledge Graphs. The World Wide Web Conference on - WWW '19**:** 1398-1408.*). 

Base code is adapted from https://github.com/eXascaleInfolab/ActiveLink, but the implementation of meta-incremental training is re-implemented in neater code, and some bugs are fixed as well. 



This repo is actively maintained. If any questions, feel free to contact via christang_1023@outlook.com or do a PR!   :P
